- Post-crisis investigation reports with expert analyses

### 1.4 Academic Business Schools
**Source**: MIT Sloan, Wharton, Stanford case repositories  
**Cost**: Free (public teaching cases)
**Focus**: Crisis management pedagogy and expert frameworks

## Phase 2: Validation Methodology

### 2.1 Case Study Analysis Framework
For each selected case study:

**Data Extraction:**
- **Crisis Scenario**: Initial situation and challenges
- **Stakeholder Map**: Internal/external parties involved
- **Time Pressure**: Urgency level and timeline constraints
- **Expert Solution**: Published recommended approach
- **Expert Scoring**: If available, expert assessment criteria
- **Actual Outcome**: Real-world results and lessons learned

**Standardization Process:**
1. Convert case to CrisisPM format (13 categories, 4 difficulty levels)
2. Extract expert assessment criteria and scoring rationale
3. Map to 4-dimensional scoring framework (Strategy, Communication, Leadership, Execution)
4. Document expected score ranges for each dimension

### 2.2 AI Assessment Testing Protocol
**Step 1: Blind Assessment**
- Feed crisis scenario to AI system without expert solution
- Collect AI-generated assessment and scoring
- Record response time and token usage

**Step 2: Expert Comparison**  
- Compare AI assessment against published expert analysis
- Calculate similarity scores across 4 dimensions
- Identify areas of alignment and divergence
- Document reasoning quality and actionable feedback

**Step 3: Correlation Analysis**
- Measure correlation between AI scores and expert scores
- Calculate overall similarity percentage (target: >80%)
- Analyze consistency across different crisis categories
- Track improvement over prompt iterations

### 2.3 Success Metrics
**Quantitative Measures:**
- **Correlation Coefficient**: AI vs Expert scoring (target: r > 0.8)
- **Assessment Accuracy**: Percentage alignment with expert recommendations (target: >80%)
- **Consistency Score**: Variation in AI assessment across similar scenarios (target: <15%)
- **Response Quality**: Actionable feedback percentage (target: >90%)

**Qualitative Measures:**
- **Comprehensiveness**: Coverage of all critical crisis aspects
- **Practicality**: Feasibility of recommended actions
- **Clarity**: Understandability of feedback for PM practitioners
- **Professional Tone**: Appropriate language and structure
